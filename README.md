# DataQuest Project 14: Spam Filter Using Naive Bayes

This is the 14th project I completed in the "Data Analyst in Python" and "Data Scientist in Python" paths from Dataquest. The goal of this project was to construct a model based on the naive Bayes algorithm to categorize SMS messages as either spam or ham (not spam). This was my first project based on machine learning and the resulting spam filter showed very good results.

The educational goal of the project was to use the naive Bayes algorithm, to gain better understanding of how probability theory can be used to build a powerful machine learning model from scratch.

## Prerequisites

This project requires both the Jupyter notebook as well as the file containing the messages as well as their labels.

To run this project, you will need `Jupyter Notebooks` with a python 3 kernel to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

The project itself is written in Python 3 and uses the modules `Numpy` and `Pandas`, ` to run. These can be installed by running `pip install <name of module>` in the console.
